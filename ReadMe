New: SetupHelper includes a GUI based package mananager

The SetupHelper package provides:
    a mechanism to automatically reinstall packages following a Venus OS update
    an automatic update mechanism to keep packages up to date
        from GitHub archives or USB stick
	control of the automatic download and install from the GUI
	add and remove packages from the system
	manual download, install, uninstall from the GUI

    a "blind" install of SetupHelper from SD/USB media

	backup and restore SOME settings from com.victronenergy.settings

SetupHelper is also required for my other packages
	and must be installed BEFORE running the other package setup scripts

Blind Install:

By far, the easiest way to install SetupHelper is the "blind install"
	which requires no command-line interaction.

    1) Download venus-data.tgz from the SetupHelper GitHub repo.
    2) copy it to the root of a freshly formatted SD card or USB memory stick
    3) place the media in the GX device (Cerbo, CCGX, etc)
    4) reboot the GX device TWICE - allowing the system to display the GUI each time
        after the second reboot, you should find the Package Manager menus
        at the bottom of the Settings menu
    5) REMOVE THE MEDIA from the GX device
		VERY IMPORTANT to prevent the next reboot from starting the process all over again
		failure to do so could disable reinstalls following a Venus OS firmware update !!!

    CAUTION: This mechanism overwrites /data/rcS.local !!!!
        If you are using rcS.local to perform boot-time activities,
        /data/rcS.local must be recreated following this "blind" install
        Note that SetupHelper also uses /data/rcS.local for
        reinstallation following a firmware update so use caution in
        recreating rcS.local.

    venus-data.tgz is available here:
        https://github.com/kwindrem/SetupHelper/raw/main/venus-data.tgz
        
Other mechanisms to install SetupHelper require command-line interaction with the GX device
	and are no longer recommended for SetupHelper or my other packages

Once SetupHelper is installed, updates to it and other packages can be performed through the GUI
using the PackageManager menus.

CAUTION:
	Package Manager allows uninstalling SetupHelper.
	This can not be undone since the menus to control Package Manager will go away
	You would need to use the Blind Install again to reinstall SetupHelper
	
	Note that removal does not actually remove the package so other setup scripts
	will continue to function.

Description:

There are two parts to SetupHelper:
1) Package Manager, controls automatic and manual updates to pacakges

2) Utilities used by other packages' setup scripts.
	These resources simplfy the task of writing install/uninstall scripts
	and may be of help to others writing packages of their own.

The latter is of concern only to those writing new Venus modificaitons
or modifying an existing setup script.
These are described in detail later in the SetupHelperDescription document.

Package Manager:

The Package Manager includes a set of menus on the GX device menu system
	that allows the user to view package versions,
	control automatic package updates
	and manually install, uninstall, add and remove packages.
	
	A python program runs in the backgrouns (as a service) to do the actual
		work and to interface with the menus.

	Package Manager menu:

		The first line of this menu provides status for Package Manager,
			indicating what it is currenly doing

		Automatic GitHub downloads controls if packages are automatically downloaded
				from GitHub. This occurs if a newer version is available.
			Modes:
				Normal checks GitHub for a package once every 5 minutes 
					and waits 10 minutes after a download has occured before checking another
				Fast checks GitHub for a package once every 5 seconds (10 seconds after a download),
					then after one pass through all packages, the downloads are switched to Normal rate
				Once checks GitHub for a package at the fast rate, but only once, then dowloads are turned off
				Disable disables GitHub downloads

		Auto install packages:
			Controls whether new versions of a package are automatically installed.
			Some users may wish to have the system automatically download new updates,
			but install them manually.
			In this case, automatic GitHub downloads may be turned on and Auto install packages turned off
			
			Auto install packages also influences whether packages transferred from SD/USB media 
				are automatically installed or just transferred to local storage

		Active packages:
			displays all active packages
			
			Version information is displayed for each package:
				Git Hub shows the version found on GitHub
				Stored shows the verison stored on the GX device
				Installed shows the version actually installed and running

			Tappingn on one of the entries leads to the Package editor menu

		Inactive packages:
			displays all INACTIVE packages
				I.e., default packages not yet activated or manually removed
			The first entry is always "new" and allows the operator to enter package name, GitHub user and branch/tag
				from scratch
			Additional lines (if any) are default packages (from the defaultPackageList file)
			If a package is already added to the version list, it will not appear in the Add Package list
			
			Tapping on one of the entries leads to the Add Package menu
		
		Backup & Restore settings:
			saves settings to the settingsBackup file on removable SD/USB media
			restores from same
			/data/SetupHelper/settingsList is a complete list of settings saved to settingsBackup
				GuiMods
				SetupHelper
				ShutdownManager
				SOME Victron stock settings in the following sections
					Alarms
					CGwacs
					DigitalInputs
					Generators
					Gui
					Pump
					Relay
					System
					SystemSetup
					Vrmlogger
				Any logo files in /data/themes/overlay
			The parameters must exist to be saved
			The parameters must exist to be updated during a restore

			Note: Victron is working on a more compresenhive mechanism but is not working reliably yet
				This part of PackageManager is temporary and will be removed when the Victron functionality is working


		Package editor:
			This menu facilitates:
				manual install, uninstall, package add and package remove
				changing GitHub access information for each package

			Normally, you would want to download the latest released version
				but you may also wish to try out a beta version or revert to a previous one.
				Once the GitHub branch is changed, PackageManager will update the GitHub version
					and, if enabled, download this alternate version.

			Remove Package
				Packages that are of no interest to you may be removed from Package Manager.
				Removed packages will no longer appear in the version list or be accessible from the Package Editor menu.
				But you can add the package back in manually.

		Add package menu:
			Allows the package name, GitHub user and GitHub branch or tag to be entered.
			
			Pressing Proceed initiates the package add.
			The package will be added to the package list (and appear in the Package versions menu)
			only IF the name is unique
			
			Pressing Cancel returns to the default package list

			All three fields must be set appropriately or you'll see -- for the GitHub version

		
		Package Manager does not allow removing packages unless they are uninstalled first.
		
		Package Manager DOES permit uninstalling SetupHelper,
			however this will remove the Package Manager itself.
			Once removed, the Blind Install mechanism will be needed again !!


USB/SD updates:

	When the GX device is not connected to the internet, a USB flash drive or microSD card provides an install/upgrade path.

	To use the USB update process
		Navigate to the GitHub, repo, click on tags and select the appropirate branch or specific version tag. 
		Choose the .tar.gz download link.
		(Do not download from the Code tab or download the .zip file. These won't work.)
		Copy the archive file to a USB memory stick or microSD card.
		Do NOT unpack the archive
		Repeat this for all packages you wish to install.
		(These can all be placed on the same media along with the SetupHelper venus-data.tgz file)
		Insert the stick in the GX device. 
		If SetupHelper has not yet been installed, follow the Blind Install process above.
		Once Package Manager is running, it will transfer and unpack the archive files
			and update the package list with the new packages. 
		If Auto install packages is turned on, the packages will then be installed
		
		NOTE: no vesion checks are made for packages found on SD/USB media!
			Package Manager is quite content to transfer and install an older version!
			So make sure you have the latest version especially if your GX device does not have internet access.
